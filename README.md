# Challenge Project: Number Guesser

## Project Goals 
In this Codecademy project, I was tasked to write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game.

## Description
This was my first JavaScript project. Though it was short, it was good practice to see how JS can be used in combination with HTML and CSS to create an interesting, responsive website.

## Project Requirements
1. Create a function to generate a new secret target number at the start of each new round.
2. Create a function to determine if either the user's or computer's guess is closest to the target number.
3. Create a function to increase the winner's score after each round.
4. Create a function to update the round number after each round.
5. Test that the code is working properly by invoking your newly written functions within script.js with sample inputs.
